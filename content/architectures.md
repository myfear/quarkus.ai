## What Is an AI-Infused Application?

AI-infused applications seamlessly embed intelligent behavior into the systems your business already depends on. Unlike standalone ML models or isolated data science workflows, AI-infused apps integrate predictive and generative capabilities directly into operational pipelines, APIs, and UIsâ€”where decisions happen in real time.

The diagram above illustrates the foundational components of an AI-infused application. Each stage builds on the one before it, forming an integrated architecture:

### Data Preparation
This is where raw enterprise data is transformed into usable inputs for AI models. It includes ETL pipelines, semantic enrichment, vectorization, document parsing, and metadata tagging. In Java applications with Quarkus, this layer often uses Camel integrations, document parsing with Apache Tika or Docling, or LangChain4j document loaders.

### Serving
This layer hosts the intelligence. It may include local LLMs via Ollama, vector stores for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), or decision models exposed via REST or gRPC. Quarkus supports native image builds and fast-start containers, making real-time AI feasible even at the edge.

### Discovery & Access
Applications must know when and how to use AI responsibly. This layer handles tool selection, reasoning chains, prompt engineering, access policies, observability, and user context. LangChain4j orchestration components live here, often using Quarkus Messaging for parallelism and agent communication.

### Application Components
This is where the business value is delivered. APIs, chat interfaces, workflow engines, and UIs consume AI-generated insights in real time. With Quarkus, these components are fast, reactive, and secure. Whether exposing customer insights, automating reports, or assisting human decisions.

AI-infused applications combine traditional business logic with artificial intelligence capabilities including.

- **Hybrid reasoning**: Combining rule-based logic with AI inference
- **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**: Enhancing AI responses with business data
- **Tool use**: Enabling AI to interact with your existing systems
- **Inference**: Real-time AI decision making within business workflows
